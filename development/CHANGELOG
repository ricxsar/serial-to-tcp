0.1.6 (2012-03-29)
==================

Refactorings and some extra monitoring features.

Features:
	* The monitor option now accepts the values {true,ascii,hex}. Hex mode will output
	  all data in hex notation. Ascii mode will escape characters before space, and output
	  hex for characters above 127.
	* The noExpansion option was removed.
	
Fixes:
	* The package now depends on the node-commandline package for command-line parsing.
	* The package correctly works with octets (buffers) instead of utf-8 strings.
	
The monitor option now knows th
0.1.5 (2012-03-27)
==================

Implemented a command line class, that will parse the arguments, and attach them to the
matching attributes of the commandLine object. This way, we can support out of order named
arguments, and easier use of arguments at run-time.

Features:
	* Command line parsing externalized into a separate class.
	* Supports the -debug option, which will output some extra information.
	* Supports the -noExpansion option, which will disable expansion of ascii strings.
	* Supports the -help option, which will print usage and exit.
	
Fixes:
	* Shell script uses $@ in order to pass-on all arguments from the shell.

0.1.4 (2012-03-27)
==================

Added ascii expansion, and an option to specify the listening interface.

Features:
	* In monitoring mode, the serialserver will now expand ascii characters below 32 (space)
	  to the corresponding character name within the ascii table. For example, the \0 character
	  will be rendered as <NUL>.
	* It's now possible to specify the listening interface as an optional argument.

0.1.3 (2012-03-27)
==================

Fixed NPM pacakge

Fixes:
	* Correctly specified node version
	* The start script has been updated in order to detect the prefix/installation mode.

0.1.2 (2012-03-27)
==================

First NPM package.

Features:
	* NPM pacakge.json
	* NPM installable
	
2012-03-27
==========

Second draft release.

Features:
	* The build script creates a binary release including the serialport npm module.
	* A batch file for running the tool on Windows platforms.

    * The build script handles spaces in directories correctly.

2012-03-26
==========

First draft release for early testing.

Features:
	* Listening to a serial port
	* Accepting multiple incoming connections
	* Oldest connection has write permission to the port.
	* Write permission is propagated to next connection upon closure of the connection that has
	  current write permission.
	* Terminates on Ctrl-C (SIGINT) or shutdown (SIGTERM).
	* Takes path to the serial port, baudrate, tcp port number as command line arguments.
	* -monitor option enables console monitoring.

Fixes:
	* N/A

Usage:
	* Enter the command line (with node js installed and on the path):
		node serial-tcp-server.js [-<option>..] </path/to/serialPort> <baudrate> <tcpPortNumber> [<interface>]
	* Options:
		-monitor	Enabled monitoring of communications.
